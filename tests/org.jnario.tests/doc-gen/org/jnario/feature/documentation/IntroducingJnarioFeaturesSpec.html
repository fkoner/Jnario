<p>Jnario Features are based on <a href="http://www.xtend-lang.org">Xtend</a>. It is a good idea to read the Xtend <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/index.html">documentation</a> before you get started with Jnario, because expressions, fields, methods and extensions in Jnario work exactly as in Xtend.</p>
<h3 class="exampleGroup notrun"  id="How_to_write_a_Feature">How to write a Feature?</h3>
<p>First of all you need a running installation of Jnario. If you haven't installed Jnario yet, follow the <a href="../../jnario/documentation/InstallingJnarioSpec.html">install guide</a>. To get started create a new specification using the spec wizard (<strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>New</strong> -&gt; <strong>Other</strong> -&gt; <strong>Jnario</strong> -&gt; <strong>Feature</strong>).</p><p><p align="center"><img src="/img/tutorial/feature_wizard.png" alt="New Feature Wizard"/></p></p><p><span class="label label-info">Tip</span> If the editor shows a validation error, because of the missing jnario libraries, add them to the classpath using the quickfix (CMD/Ctrl + 1).</p><p>A feature file consists of a feature and the scenarios that are the acceptance criteria for the feature. For the calculator the the feature description in form of a story and one scenario for adding numbers looks as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-feature">
Feature: Calculator

  As a math dummy
  I want a calculator that helps me with basic math operations
  In order to check my capabilities

  Scenario: Adding two numbers

    Given a calculator
    When I enter two numbers and press add
    Then it should show the sum
</pre><p>A feature consists of the name of the feature, it's narrative and a number of scenarios. The narrative can be arbitrary text. You should use it to describe the rationale of the feature. Those scenarios are examples for the behavior expected from the feature. Possible scenarios for the calculator are, for example, addition or subtraction.</p><p>Each scenario is defined by the steps that describe the expected behavior. <strong>Given</strong> steps give all the necessary information about the context of the scenario. <strong>When</strong> describes the action and <strong>Then</strong> describes the expected outcome that we want to verify. You can use the keyword <strong>And</strong> to split a step into different sub steps.</p><p>When you save the file an xtend-gen folder will be created and the corresponding generated java files will be created. Those files can be executed as JUnit-Tests. It is possible to run those tests directly from the feature file. Right click in the feature file after saving it and select <strong>Run As</strong> -&gt; <strong>JUnit Test</strong>. You will see the result of the run and it will be green. Since the steps from scenario are not implemented yet all the steps will be marked as <em>PENDING</em> as a reminder that there is still work to do.</p>
<ul><li><p id="Implementing_Steps" class="example notrun"><strong>Implementing Steps</strong></p>
<p>To turn our scenario into an executable specification you have to add the necessary code to each of our steps. For each step the implementation is done directly after the description of the step. The language used to define the logic is <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/index.html#fields">Xtend</a>. Create a Java class with the name Calculator in the same project as your feature file. Add the necessary import to the feature file or include it by auto completion while typing (CTRL + SPACE).</p><p><span class="label label-info">Info</span> Specifying the package and declaring and importing other packages works similar to Xtend (static imports work as well).</span></p><p>First we will declare a field <code>Calculator calculator</code> which we initialize in our <strong>Given</strong> step (we could also directly initialize the field <code>Calculator calculator = new Calculator</code>). We will also create a integer field named <code>result</code> to store the result of our calculation. Variables that are defined after the scenario description and before the first step are fields inside of the scenario. This means every step can use fields that were declared after the scenario description. Variables that are declared with var or val after a step description can only be used locally inside the step.</p><p>In the <strong>When</strong> step we call <code>add</code> on the calculator that also needs the two numbers that should be added. In a Jnario feature it is possible to define parameters inside of a step description. Parameters can be defined in steps using quotes: <code>&quot;I am a parameter&quot;</code>. Within your step implementation, you can access these parameters by an implicitly created variable <code>args</code>.</p><p>The parameters from the when step are passed to the add method. Jnario provides some <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/index.html#extensionMethods">extension methods</a> that simplify converting strings to other primitives. Here we use the <code>toInt</code> extension to convert the string parameter into an integer. Finally, the return value of the add method is assigned to the <code>result</code> field.</p><p>Now we need to define a method <code>add</code> in our calculator to remove the compile errors. In the <strong>Then</strong> step we will assert the behavior of our calculator. For writing readable short assertions different additional assertions come with Jnario. All of the possibilities are described <a href="/org/jnario/spec/tests/integration/AssertionSpec.html">here</a>. Here we use for describing the expected outcome of an expression <code>=&gt;</code>.</p>
